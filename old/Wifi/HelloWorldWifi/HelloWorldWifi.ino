//   5v powered, you MUST "level shift" TX/RX to 3v3, a zener 
//   like this will work, do it for both TX and RX
//
// [ARDUINO 8] => [1k Resistor] => + => [ESP8266 TX]

//                                 + => [(cathode) 3v3 Zener Diode (anode) ] => GROUND
//
// [ARDUINO 9] => [1k Resistor] => + => [ESP8266 RX]

// The ESP8266 RST pin and CH_PD pin must both be connected to 3v3 
// (best via a 1k resistor).  The PWR must go to 3v3, and GND to
//  ground of course.   The other pins can be left floating for 
//  normal operation.

  char buffer[250]; // Remember, SRAM is very limited, think carefully about
                    // how big a buffer you really need!

  
  // Now we copy the request path into the buffer.  In this case, the request
  // path is a fixed string, so I store it in FLASH with PSTR and copy it into
  // the buffer with strncpy_P, taking care to leave at least one byte for 
  // the null string terminator.

  //                         500 = SERVER ERROR

  //  We may also give you a response code below 100, this indicates

  // * Hostname Note: 
  //
  //  tldr; If you don't provide a hostname, you won't typically get a valid response
  //      code, and you will only be able to contact the default website on a shared IP
  //      but the server will usually 'dumb down' the response for us so it is a bit faster.
  //
  //   Longer Explanation:  
  //
  //   The hostname argument can be set to NULL (or empty string if you like),
  //   if you don't provide it, then we will not send an HTTP version string
  //   with the request.  This will usually make the server behave more "simply"
  //   and not send headers, or status code, it will just dump out the response
  //   body to us, which is nice.  Also, if the IP has more than one website 
  //   attached to it, the request would go to the default website on that IP.
  //
  //   If you do specify the hostname, we will add a version HTTP/1.0 to the 
  //   request.  We can then get headers from this request if you wish.  The 
  //   reason for using HTTP/1.0 instead of 1.1 is that 1.1 introduces 
  //   "chunked" transfer encoding, which would make parsing even slower,
  //   which is not a good thing, giving HTTP/1.0 to an Apache server seems to
  //   force it to avoid chunked encoding with no particular detriment.
